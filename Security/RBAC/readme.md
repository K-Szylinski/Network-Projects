## 📖 Project Overview
This project focuses on **Infrastructure Hardening** and implementing a **Defense-in-Depth** strategy for enterprise network devices.

Unlike standard routing labs, this exercise emphasizes securing the **Management Plane** and **Control Plane** of routers. The goal is to mitigate common attack vectors (e.g., unauthorized access, route injection, man-in-the-middle) and establish robust auditing and monitoring capabilities using NTP and Syslog.

## 🔐 Security Implementations

### 1. 🛂 Secure Management Access (Hybrid Approach)
* **Tiered Access Strategy:** Retained Telnet for isolated internal LAN management (Private Zone) while strictly enforcing **SSHv2** with 1536-bit RSA keys for secure remote administration of the Edge Router (GATE4).
* **Management Plane Protection (MPP):** Applied **Standard Access Control Lists (ACLs)** to VTY lines, restricting administrative access to a specific "Admin PC" only.
* **Login Security:** Enforced minimum password length, configured `service password-encryption`, and set aggressive execution timeouts.

### 2. 📡 Control Plane Security (OSPF Authentication)
* **Route Authentication:** Configured **Cryptographic Authentication (MD5/HMAC)** for OSPFv2 neighbors.
* **Objective:** Prevents rogue routers from forming adjacencies and injecting malicious routes (poisoning) into the global routing table.

### 3. 👁️ Auditing & Monitoring (NTP & Syslog)
* **Secure NTP:** Configured Authenticated NTP (Network Time Protocol) hierarchical topology (Stratum 3) to ensure precise timestamp synchronization across all devices.
* **Centralized Logging:** Enabled **Syslog** forwarding to a central cloud server to store audit trails of configuration changes and interface events.

### 4. 🎭 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
* **Parser Views:** Implemented **Cisco IOS Role-Based CLI Access**.
* **Segregation of Duties:** Created restricted views (e.g., `Admin2`), limiting junior admins to specific commands (e.g., `show ip`, `debug`) while denying access to global configuration modes.
